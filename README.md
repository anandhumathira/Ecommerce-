Ecommerce Website



The E-commerce Website project aims to develop a robust and scalable online
platform using Node.js as the server-side runtime and MongoDB as the
database. This platform will provide users with an intuitive and secure
shopping experience while offering administrators a powerful tool to manage
products, orders, and user data.
